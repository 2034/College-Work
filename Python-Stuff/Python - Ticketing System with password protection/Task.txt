Modify the Ticketing program so that it asks the user for a password to enter the program. If they get it wrong 3 times they are not allowed to use the program.

Also once password is correct make the code repeat until the user selects exit

Hint - look at previous examples

Algorithm

            else if choice is 2
                calculate child
            else if choice is 3
                calculate student
            else is choice is 4
