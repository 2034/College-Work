Use a function to get and return student mark

Make sure to use Comments to explain what is happening

For 3 attempts
    Ask user for password
    IF password incorrect
        Display error message
    ELSE 
        Welcome to the Grading Program
        WHILE exit not chosen
            Get student Name
            Get Student Mark
            If the mark is >= 70 print out that student name and that they got an A
            else If the mark is >= 60 print out that student name and that they got a B
            else If the mark is >= 50 print out that student name and that they got a C
            else print out student name and that they failed
            END IF
        Ask user if they want to run again
        END WHILE
END FOR

Also once password is correct make the code repeat until the user selects exit
