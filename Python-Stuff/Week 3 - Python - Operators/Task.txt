Step 1
Create a variable first_number and assign it the value 5
create a variable second_number and assign it the value 10
then use the Print Function to print these variables

Step 2
Use the variables you created in step 1 and use the print function to add these two values together
create a second print function to subtract the first number from the second
create a third print function to multiply the first number and the second
create a fourth print function to divide the second number by the first

Step 3
Beneath your previous print function 
create four more variables 
addition
subtraction
multiplication
division

using the above operators and the variables first_number and second_number
use these variable to store the results of the associated sums and then print them out
finally comment out what each equation is doing.
