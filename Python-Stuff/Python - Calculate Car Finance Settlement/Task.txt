Create an Algorithm and flowchart then write a program that will ask the user for a month as an Integer and calculate how much has been paid towards a car and then calculate a Settlement figure

For example, if the user enters February, then  the payments for January & February are added together and then subtracted from the Balance. 

Settlement Figure = Balance - Payments

The Balance is 2500
The program should store the car payments in each month in an array. The values are as follows:
January 160
February 160
March 150
April 150
May 150
June 150
July 160
August 155
September 150
October 160
November 150
December 150
