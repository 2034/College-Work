## Info

In the first week, we were told to make a website for the end project.  
I decided to do it using the format I currently use, but then they decided to auto-pass everyone in that course since we had already done it earlier in the year.  

Was also my first time resizing to different resolutions 

### Issue
The only issue with the website is that when using a video in the assets page, it messes up the sizing.
